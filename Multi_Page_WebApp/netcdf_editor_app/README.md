Collection of python files (this probably needs to be cleaned up a lot ...)

- In the __root__ of this folder we have the tools that are used to create the flask app and intergrate with the database
- __Holoviews__ holds the panel apps notably the files used to create the interactive dashboards to modify files
- __Static__ holds static files for the flask app
- __Templates__ holds the jinja2 templates used to build the flask web app
- __utils__ holds custom algorithms that are run notably in the `python_worker` -> __THIS SHOULD PROBABLY BE SEPARATED__
